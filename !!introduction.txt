I'm a Vietnamese who is bilingual and sucks at my own native language, I prefer English.
Calculus reduces stress for me, it's my safe place
Math is beautiful and logical :)
I'm an introvert, so if you see me not responding to what you say, I'm probably thinking about some random stuff, or doing integrals in my head, sorry if it bothers you
I'm usually not the type of person who flexes their achievements
