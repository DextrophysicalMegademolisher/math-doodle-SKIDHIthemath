I'm a AMERICAN who is not bilingual and sucks at my own native language.
Calculus... uh idek
Math is beautiful and logical :)
I'm an introvert, so if you see me not responding to what you say, I'm probably eating
I'm usually the type of person who flexes their achievements, I'm not usually the one who is secretly up to something
Turns out I didn't know what a continued fraction was in BLA BLA BLA I DIDNT WRITE THIS

I get bullied a lot in schools, but I don't care and usually focus on the positive side, where I have a lot of friends online
This txt document makes me comfortable describing myself because I feel no pressure to rush (dang cvd im sorry)

My logo was inspired by when I DIDNT MAKE THIS LOGO
